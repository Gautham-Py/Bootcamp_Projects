The Game in itself is quite elaborate and self-explanatory.

    The board Layout is made using dictionary 
    in which keys will be the location(i.e : top-left,mid-right,etc.)
    and initialliy it's values will be empty space and then after every move 
    it will change the value according to player's choice of number. 


*** Future Work ***

1. The code is a basic version for playing the game in python.
    There are advanced versions available(you can google them{ hint: "pygame"})

2. The given code entails a small bug, i.e, when a player enters "0" or any other key 
    instead of a number, the code fails to run. Try correcting this as a part of Learning.
    {hint: a simple "if condition" at the right place will do the magic}

3. All the Best!!!.... Have Fun :)
